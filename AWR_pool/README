This is an R project that looks at the slates for county commissioner boards from 2008 to 2018, and may be extended as time moves along.

Data is to be found in the repo AWR_data_only.

The voter registration file, being very large, is in an AWS repository as a processed .RData file, at 
https://s3.amazonaws.com/are-we-represented/NCSBE_data/ncvoter/df_ncvoter_subset_distinct_demog_20180407.RData

In its original form it is the file ncvoter_Statewide_20180407.txt

There are three R markdown scripts that make everything work:

read_ncvoter_standalone.Rmd processes the NCSBE voter registration file (see above).
You may want to run this once but do not run it every time you do something with this project.
It never changes!

prep_complete.Rmd creates the R objects needed for the analysis.

compact_updates.Rmd USES THE OUTPUT of prep_complete.Rmd
It painstakingly processes the NCSBE pdf candidate lists to filter names of candidates.

A subsequent R markdowm file, pool_report.Rmd, is the report based on
THE OUTPUT of both the preceding Rmd files.

The first three of these incorporate file paths (data_dir, etc.) that stipulate just where
files exist and to where they will be written. Change these as you find convenient.
