This folder, and its descendants, comprise an R project that explores and cleans data from the Census Bureau, NCSBE (State Board of 
Elections), and NCACC (Association of County Commissioners). This is intended to be the basis for a back end for any of the public-facing 
parts of the Are We Represented project. It should be of interest to anyone who wants to get into the details of the data available 
from these several sources. Rather than complete, AWR_data_munging is intended to be informative, and as a place for addressing such
topics as standardizing race and ethnicity coding.

Due to the large size of the NCSBE data files (and the data structures derived from them), some files are located in an AWS S3 instance, 
at https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-2# Documentation regarding access to this will be provided soon
(as soon as I can figure out what to say).

There are three R scripts integral to using AWR_data_munging: .Rprofile (a minimal set of required packages), and two rmarkdown scripts,
AWR_Census_NCACC.Rmd and AWR_NCSBE.Rmd

AWR_NCSBE.Rmd defaults to use the NCSBE ncvoter and ncvhis files date stamped 4/7/2018, located in the AWS S3 instance. They use
specifically the data for the 11/8/2016 General Election, grepped from the ncvhis file. You are welcome to change to use of data for
other dates - just be very careful about making the few changes that will be necessary, and should be obvious, in the script.

I have tried to write readily understandable R, relying primarily on dplyr. Please observe the requirements of reproducible research
in whatever changes or extensions you make.
